how to define tiles:

2 VBOs:
VBO 1 contains vertices as 3 floating point values
VBO 2 contains indices for vertex's color as a single byte

both are combined into a VAO that is stored in a array of tiles

each array of tiles contains 256 VAOs
s.t. they can be indexed with a single byte
tile 0 is always clear

the palette to use are passed to the vertex shader as a uniform of 3 vec3
[!] indeed, color 0 is always clear, and colors 1,2,3 are always opaque



voxel NES fantasy console:

screen res = 128×128×128
2 screen buffers = 16×16×16 tiles

64 sprites
sprite res = 8×8×8

8 palettes of 4 colors
color 0 is always clear



==== TODO: figure out something that makes sense...
assembly like with 8 registers: A B C D W X Y Z
only operate on 16bits words
str A  in @0xFFFF
str 10 in A
cmp A B in D
add A B in C
